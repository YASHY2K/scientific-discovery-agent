## **A Serverless Architecture for the Autonomous Research Agent on AWS**

### **Section 1: Executive Summary & Architectural Vision**

#### **1.1. Project Mandate and Architectural Vision**

The primary mandate of this project is to develop a **highly autonomous, collaborative multi-agent AI system** capable of intelligently discovering, processing, and reasoning over a dynamically expanding corpus of scientific literature. This system will dramatically accelerate the traditionally laborious process of literature review, transforming months of manual effort into minutes of automated, rigorous research.

The architectural vision is a **fully serverless, event-driven, and transparent ("Glass Box")** system built entirely on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. This approach maximizes agility, inherent scalability, and cost-efficiency while fundamentally minimizing operational overhead. By extensively leveraging AWS managed services for compute (AWS Lambda), orchestration (AWS Strands Agents SDK, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore), storage (Amazon S3, DynamoDB), and advanced AI capabilities (Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Titan Embeddings), the development team can focus almost exclusively on refining the complex multi-agent reasoning, planning, and synthesis logic.

This architecture will empower a team of specialized AI agents to autonomously perform a complete, end-to-end cycle of academic paper discovery, retrieval, deep analysis, self-critique, and comprehensive report generation. The ultimate goal is to transform raw scientific information into actionable intelligence, significantly accelerating the pace of scientific innovation.

#### **1.2. Core Architectural Principles**

The design of the Autonomous Research Agent is guided by several foundational principles:

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** A hierarchical structure where a primary Orchestrator Agent intelligently delegates tasks to specialized agents (Planner, Searcher, Analyzer, Critique, Reporter) using the AWS Strands Agents SDK's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. This mirrors a human research team's collaborative dynamic.
- **Strict Agent-Tool Distinction:** Clear separation between non-deterministic, LLM-powered reasoning agents and deterministic, reliable utility functions (tools). Agents make decisions; tools execute specific tasks reliably.
- **"Glass Box" Transparency:** Every thought, decision, tool invocation, and result from all agents is streamed in real-time to the user interface, providing unprecedented visibility and fostering trust in the AI's conclusions.
- **Event-Driven & Serverless:** The entire system operates on a publish-subscribe model, leveraging AWS Lambda for compute, API Gateway for interfaces, SNS for event routing, and managed storage services for state, ensuring infinite scalability, high availability, and pay-per-use cost efficiency.
- **AI-Native Design:** Deep integration with Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet for reasoning, Titan Embeddings for semantic search) as the core intelligence layer for all agentic decision-making and content understanding.
- **Iterative & Self-Correcting:** Agents, particularly the Research Critique Agent, are designed to evaluate their own output, identify gaps or inaccuracies, and trigger iterative refinement loops to ensure high-quality, comprehensive results.
- **Robustness & Resilience:** Incorporates mechanisms for state persistence, error handling, retries, and caching to ensure reliable operation and recoverability from transient failures.

### **Section 2: System Components and Data Flow**

This section breaks down the system into its logical layers and explains the end-to-end flow of a research task.

#### **2.1. Frontend and API Layers: The User's Gateway**

The user interacts with the system through a **React Single-Page Application (SPA)**, which is a modern, responsive web interface. This application is hosted on **Amazon S3** and delivered globally with low latency via **Amazon CloudFront**. This entirely serverless setup ensures the user interface is always available and fast, no matter where the user is located.

When a user submits a research query, the frontend communicates with the backend through **Amazon API Gateway**, which provides two distinct endpoints:

1.  A **REST API** for initiating tasks. A `POST` request to a `/research` endpoint kicks off the entire workflow.
2.  A **WebSocket API** for real-time communication. After the task starts, the frontend establishes a persistent WebSocket connection to receive live progress updates. This is the technical backbone of the "Glass Box" experience.

#### **2.2. The Agent Tier: An Autonomous Research Team**

The core of the system is a team of six specialized AI agents, all built using the **AWS Strands Agents SDK** and running within a single, powerful **AWS Lambda** function. Each agent is a distinct, non-deterministic reasoning entity powered by **Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Sonnet**.

1.  **The Primary Orchestrator Agent:** This is the team leader. It receives the initial user query and is responsible for the overall strategy. It doesn't perform the detailed research itself but intelligently delegates tasks to its specialist agents. It decides the sequence of operations and adaptively re-plans based on feedback.

2.  **The Specialist Agents:** These are five expert agents that the Orchestrator can call upon. In the Strands framework, they are exposed to the Orchestrator as intelligent "tools" via the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.
    - **Planner Agent:** The strategist. It takes the user's high-level goal and creates a detailed, structured research plan, including key search terms and success criteria.
    - **Searcher Agent:** The librarian. It executes searches using deterministic tools to query academic databases. It adds a layer of intelligence by refining search queries and evaluating the relevance of the results.
    - **Analyzer Agent:** The analyst. It performs a deep technical analysis of the papers found, synthesizing key methodologies, comparing findings, and identifying novel contributions.
    - **Critique Agent:** The quality assurance specialist. This agent reviews the work of the other agents, checking for completeness, accuracy, and logical coherence. It provides specific feedback and can trigger a crucial **feedback loop**, forcing the other agents to revise and improve their work.
    - **Reporter Agent:** The technical writer. Once the research is approved by the Critique Agent, this agent compiles all the validated findings into a comprehensive, well-structured final report.

#### **2.3. The Tool Tier: Deterministic, Reliable Functions**

Tools are the reliable, deterministic functions that the agents choose to use. They do not reason; they execute a specific task. Each tool is implemented as a separate, single-purpose **AWS Lambda** function for isolation and independent scaling.

- **`arxiv_search_tool`:** Takes a query string and reliably returns a list of papers from the arXiv API.
- **`pdf_text_extractor`:** Takes a PDF URL, downloads the file, extracts its text content, and caches the result in S3 to avoid redundant work.
- **`semantic_search_tool`:** Takes a query and a list of papers, uses Amazon Bedrock's Titan Embeddings to rank the papers by semantic relevance.
- **`citation_lookup_tool`:** Takes a paper ID and fetches its citation data from an external database.

#### **2.4. Data and Notification Layers: The System's Memory and Voice**

- **Amazon DynamoDB:** Two tables form the system's memory.

  - `Research Tasks Table`: Stores the high-level status and metadata for each research job.
  - `WebSocket Connections Table`: Maps active connections to research sessions for targeted real-time updates.
  - The Strands framework uses this persistent storage for **agent memory**, ensuring long-running tasks can be paused and resumed.

- **Amazon S3:** Two buckets are used for object storage.

  - `Cache Bucket`: Stores extracted PDF text and other intermediate results to improve speed and reduce costs.
  - `Reports Bucket`: Stores the final, downloadable research reports.

- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):** This is the system's "voice." Whenever an agent takes a significant action (e.g., starts thinking, calls a tool, receives a result), it publishes a message to an SNS topic. A dedicated **WebSocket Relay Lambda** listens to this topic and immediately pushes the update to the user's browser via the WebSocket connection, creating the live "Glass Box" view.

This architecture creates a powerful, transparent, and truly autonomous system. By clearly separating the reasoning "Agents" from the executing "Tools" and using a model-driven framework like AWS Strands, the system can dynamically plan and adapt, mirroring the collaborative process of a human research team while operating at the scale and speed of the cloud.
